# AIF
Asynchronous Invocation Framework (AIF) is a framework that allows for asynchronous calls to a service or system.<br>
It can be used to invoke a service without having to wait for the response to complete, allowing for faster execution and more efficient use of resources. AIF also enables parallel execution of requests, allowing for more efficient and faster execution.
